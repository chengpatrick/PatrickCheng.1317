This is the README file for the Core Interpreter project.

Number of files: 4

Files:
Tokenizer.java
Description: This is the tokenizer class file written in java

Interpreter.java
Description: This is the interpreter file that takes the tokenized program, parses it, prints it out and executes the program.

Printer.java
Description: This is the printer class file used for indentation for the interpreter. This is not the same printer used in the interpreter class.

To compile this program just open it in Eclipse IDE and press run the Interpreter.java
When compiling this file, the program will ask the user to enter the file for the interpreter, the program will then read in the text in the file, tokenize it, parse it, print it and execute it. The program will first pretty print the parsed program and then execute the program. It will ask the user for input if there are any read statements in the program. The program will also output variable values if there are write statements in the program.
